Add easy Frequently Asked Questions to your WordPress website. Answers are shown (slide-down) after a visitor clicks on a question.

== Description ==
When i noticed i was setting up FAQ\'s on multiple projects i decided to build an easy plugin for it. Simple and Small, but does what it needs to do.

First plugin that is submitted, but then again, it\'s really simple so there can\'t be that much bugs in it. ;-)

If it\'s getting used a lot, I will add new features; Always open for ideas!

== Installation ==
I recommend to install plugins via your WordPress Dashboard.

For manual installation:
Download mklasen\'s FAQ Plugin (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/mklasens-faq/).

To install mklasen\'s FAQ follow these steps:

- Upload the folder \"mklasens-faq\" to your WordPress plugin folder (/wp-content/plugins/)
- Activate the plugin through the \'Plugins\' menu in WordPress
